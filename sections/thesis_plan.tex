\section{Thesis Plan}

To demonstrate the validity of the proposed mechanism, we plan to test different trading policies 
on different workloads.

% if i want to implement the mechanism on kubernetes, need to mention it here
% and add an implementation section

\subsection{Data Collection}
Test different policies and different synthetic workloads on the simulator. 
Run production workloads on the simulator and compare changes.

\subsection{Evaluation}
% Variables
1- workloads % encompasses cluster util
2- policies 
3- cluster sizes

% Measurments
1- From thesis outcomes :
    1-1- Average job completion time
    1-2- Average cluster utilization
    1-3- Average cost reduction

2- Mechanism specific: 
   2-1- time taken to find lender
   2-2- overhead of borrowing on lender
   2-3- ...
