\textbf{Thesis Statement:}
In a multi-cluster architecture, it is possible to increase cluster resource utilization, 
decrease average job completion time, and/or reduce average cost by 
providing clusters with a resource trading mechanism and a pluggable policy interface allowing the 
virtual sharing of resources across clusters.

% Concept introduction
% Do not communicate by sharing memory           ; instead, share memory    by communicating.
% Do not communicate by changing server ownership; instead, share resources by communicating.

% I don't want to mention capacity or whatever need because that is policy dependent
When needed, a cluster communicates with other clusters visible to it, requesting to use resources. A policy 
controls when a cluster requests those resources and when other clusters accept providing them. 
A simple example to that is in the Lyra system, were the requester's (training cluster) policy is request 
when cluster is over-subscribed, and the receiver's (inference cluster) policy is accept when 
utilization is below 98\% \cite{li_lyra_2023}. The trading mechanism is what allows clusters to use each others 
resources without forfeiting ownership of their resources. 

Our mechanism offers bidirectional trading, allowing clusters to trade resources with one another. It also 
enables trading with multiple clusters, so clusters can trade resources with more than one cluster at a time. \label{sched-overhead} 
% Policy intro
Policies are created to optimize a specific performance metric, acting as knobs to 
tune the mechanism and update it as cluster requirements change. They are a set of rules that dictate how each 
cluster handles trading. Policies are pluggable and mutable, meaning each cluster can implement its own request and receive 
policy, and dynamically update it as requirements or conditions change.

The following algorithms show a simple representation of the system, with resource utilization as the 
optimized-for metric: \label{example}

% Example Algorithm
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Trading Scheduling Algorithm - Requester}
\begin{algorithmic}
    \For{job in WaitQueue}
        \State $scheduled \gets ScheduleJob(job)$
        \If{$scheduled \neq True$ \&\& Policy(job) $==$ True} 
        \State $requestResources(job)$
        \EndIf
    \EndFor

    \For{job in ReadyQueue}
        \State $scheduled \gets ScheduleJob(job)$
        \If{$scheduled \neq True$}
        \State $WaitQueue \gets WaitQueue + job$
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Trading Scheduling Algorithm - Receiver}
    \begin{algorithmic}
            \State $ resources \gets BorrowRequest $ \Comment{Incoming from another cluster} 
            \If{$Policy(resources) = True$} 
            \State $sendAcceptRequest(job, cluster)$
            \State $prepareResources(resources)$
            \State $allowAccess$
            \EndIf
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} 

Similar to delay scheduling \cite{zaharia_delay_2010}, the scheduler tries to schedule jobs locally first, and 
expands options gradually. 

The requester consults its policy when it couldn't schedule the job the second time and onwards, and the receiver 
accepts requests based on its policy too. As mentioned above, policies are pluggable and mutable, giving both the requester 
and receiver the freedom to implement and invoke them when needed.

Other possible policy examples:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reducing JCT: Request higher performing resources from other cluster. \label{jct} 
    \item Cost reduction: Request cheaper resources from other clusters when job requirements allow it. \label{cost} 
\end{enumerate}
