\section{Methodology}

% Outline Summary
Create a simulator to prove basic idea of the project work. Test different policies and different synthetic
workloads on the simulator. Run production workloads on the simulator and compare changes.

% Create a simulator to prove basic idea of the project work
Without getting into the details of the simulator explain the reasoning behind building it.
\subsection{Data Collection}
Test different policies and different synthetic workloads on the simulator. 
Run production workloads on the simulator and compare changes.
