\section{Summary}
Computer clustering is the grouping of servers to increase scalability and offer a unit of orchestration. 
One crucial component of orchastration is scheduling, i.e. finding a suitable set of nodes in the cluster 
to run a job. In this work, we aim to leverage cross-cluster communication and build a system that allows 
clusters to trade resources and improve overall performance. 
We evaluate this by running simulated experiments to find workloads and policies that 
would benefit from such a system, as well as test various policies on available production workloads.
