\section{Summary}
Computer clustering is the grouping of servers to increase scalability and offer a unit of orchestration. 
One crucial component of orchastration is scheduling, i.e. finding a suitable node in the cluster 
to run a job. In this work, we aim to leverage cross-cluster communication to build a mechanism that allows 
clusters to borrow/lend (share) resources, in an attempt to improve performance. 
To do this, we run simulated experiments to find workloads and policies that 
would benefit from such a mechanism, as well as test various policies on available production workloads.
