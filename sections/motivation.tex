\section{Motivation and Related Work}
% \section{Proposed Solution}
% We theorize that it is possible to increase resource utilization of multiple clusters through loaning. 
% The idea of resource loaning has been recently introduced, allowing over-subscribed training clusters to 
% borrow resources from traffic dependent inference clusters \cite{li_lyra_2023}.
% We plan to generalize loaning to be non-workload specific. Cluster schedulers will be able to communicate 
% with each other, borrowing/lending, buying/selling, or negotiating resources.
