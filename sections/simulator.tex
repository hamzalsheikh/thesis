\section{Simulator}
The current intuition is adding an extra layer 
of scheduling when the cluster is over-subscribed \cite{zaharia_delay_2010}, 
but the mechanism can also be implemented as an additional step in the scheduling process. 
A simulation is being built to serve as a starting point \cite{sched-github}, 
and we plan to build the project on top of Kubernetes.

I've implemented a simulation to try to mimic the how clusters can interact and test some of the policies. 
The implementation is in Go. The end goal of the simulation is the ability to deploy clusters on different 
nodes/containers and test policies.
